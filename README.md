A formant-based choir synthesiser in Max/MSP. I made this in my Masters,
years ago, but I think it sounds really cool. It could use a lot of 
work to optimize it (I didn't use poly~ properly because I didn't 
know how to use it yet). 

It uses formant synthesis to generate a number of female and male
singing voices in unison, with parameters such as vibrato, 'warble', 
various vowels, glide, and others. 

You need a MIDI controller to play it (the onscreen keyboard does NOT 
work).
